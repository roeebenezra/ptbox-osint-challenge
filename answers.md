## üîç Additional Production-Grade Tests

* Test invalid domain input (e.g. missing dot, special characters)
* Ensure subprocess timeout + error capture works
* Unit tests for result parsing (helpers.py)
* Integration tests for end-to-end scan + DB persistence

---

## ‚ö° Benchmarking & Optimization

* Use `asyncio.subprocess` to ensure non-blocking execution
* Future: switch to Redis-based task queue (e.g. Celery with FastAPI background tasks)
* Amass can be replaced with a custom DNS enumeration microservice to reduce memory usage

---

## üêå Known Bottlenecks (OSINT Tools)

* `theHarvester -b all` can take 60+ seconds due to slow external APIs
* `amass enum -passive` performs many passive lookups and can hang on slow DNS

### üîß Mitigation:

* Limit data sources during dev (e.g. `-b crtsh,anubis`)
* Add subprocess timeouts with graceful error handling
* Cache tool output by domain hash (future improvement)

#### ‚úÖ Additional Production-Grade Tests

If this were production-bound, I would add:

* **Unit tests** for all scanner logic (e.g., AmassRunner, HarvesterRunner)
* **Mocked subprocess tests** to verify command execution safely
* **Validation tests** for API inputs (e.g., domain regex, rate limits)
* **Integration tests** that simulate full scan ‚Üí DB ‚Üí frontend display
* **Frontend tests** using tools like React Testing Library or Playwright

#### üìä Benchmarking & Performance Optimization

To benchmark and optimize:

* Use **`time.perf_counter()`** or profiling tools (`cProfile`, `py-spy`) to measure scan duration
* Profile **startup time vs tool execution time**
* Benchmark frontend loading time (especially scan list) using Chrome DevTools
* Optimize by:

  * Limiting subprocess stdout buffer sizes
  * Compressing `/api/scans` response with gzip
  * Caching tool binaries (especially theHarvester which has large deps)

#### üß± Known OSINT Tool Bottlenecks & Mitigations

| Tool           | Bottleneck                          | Mitigation                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `amass`        | Long run time, large stdout         | Limit with `-timeout`, use passive-only mode |
| `theHarvester` | Web scraping can stall/hang         | Set max results and timeout via flags        |
| DB writes      | Inserting large scan artifacts      | Use bulk inserts, index artifact fields      |
| Scan merging   | High memory usage on large datasets | Stream/merge in batches instead of in-memory |

Both tools also depend on network quality and external APIs, so having clear error states and retries is key.
